The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to count the number of orders for each customer. However, it produces an error because the subquery doesn't have an alias:

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM customers c, (SELECT o.customer_id FROM orders o GROUP BY o.customer_id) 
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```

This is a common error in SQL, especially when working with subqueries.  The error message might vary across database systems, but usually indicates a syntax issue related to using the subquery without a name.
