This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: a missing alias for a subquery in the FROM clause. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to count the number of orders per customer using a subquery without giving that subquery an alias. This is crucial for the outer query to properly reference the results of the subquery.
